# Navigating the directory

In this repo I look at shrinkage/ biased estimators in light of point-by-point tennis data. 

The `code_and_data` folder holds the code for my data analysis as well as the datasets I use that come from (https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_pointbypoint)

The `full_article` folder holds the full text of the article I wrote.

The `stand_alone_snippets` folder holds stand alone short articles from my full text.
